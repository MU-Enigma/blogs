Youtube? Live-Stream? For CS club of College? Wow! Not many gets to be a part of Club Events in college. This was my first club event after joining college amidst covid. Well, unsure about what to do, I think I did a pretty good job in pulling through the "first-ever" live stream of Enigma, considering the fact that I never was a part of any kind of live-stream event ever.

To be honest, when the Vice-President of Enigma contacted me in this regard, I was a bit skeptical about the whole idea. Well, as a 'fresher' (more like a sophomore) it was too good an oppotunity to miss and get acquainted with the Club Heads and Seniors. "Yeah sure, why not!" was my quick response. Srikar, the Vice-President of Enigma immediately invited me to have a voice chat in discord to discuss about the whole plan. We decided to go with the theme, "Map Generation in Video Games." But then Srikar wanted to do something different in it. Lucky enough, we had Raghav (the ex-President of Enigma) who suggested us the idea about Conway's Game of Life. Finding it unconventional, we decided to stick to it and work on the same. We researched and learned the General Principle and Algorithms behind Conway's Game of Life. Apart from this, I researched on some common algorithms used for Map Generation in Video Games. The algorithms were interesting and I could relate them to some of the retro games that I once used to be addicted to as a kid.

I had experience with python and some common but cool libraries like numpy and matplotlib which are extremely powerful. This made the work a lot easier. Srikar worked on implementing Conway's Game of Life algorithm and code them, while I worked in giving it dimensions in Z-Axis and hence make it 3D! It was not at all hard and I enjoyed coding it. This way I became the first 2020 batch student to become a member of <a href = "https://github.com/MEC-Enigma">Enigma Organisation</a>. After making several maps using the algorithms, we were ready to put it up in the slides. 

Since it was the first live-stream for Enigma, things were pretty messy and hard to figure out. Also, it was already time for the live-stream and we had just a day left for it. We had so much to do and very less time. We had to make Posters, we had to announce in the official discord Server of Enigma, set up OBS studio and what not. Raghav helped us a lot in figuring out these stuffs. Finally we were up for the live-stream. As a bonus, we got one of our seniors, Anchit to speak on map generation in video-games who is a fantastic game-dev. Well, we thought about turning our videos on, but due to some technical difficulty, we weren't able to make that happen. But as a whole, I feel we did pretty good.

There were areas we could have done better. Well, this was not the end and we will have more live streams of this kind. Srikar and other Club Heads were happy because the live-stream was a success and attracted many more enthusiasts into the club. The enigmatic charm of Enigma must never fade.
